# hex-core [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forrest-marshall/hex-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forrest-marshall/hex-core)

Simple hexadecimal utilities for Rust.


## about

The intention of this crate is to provide a set of very basic tools for dealing with
conversion to and from hexadecimal bytes (UTF-8).  This crate is intended to serve as
a starting point for building high-level hexadecimal tooling.

See the API docs (`cargo doc --open`) for more info.
